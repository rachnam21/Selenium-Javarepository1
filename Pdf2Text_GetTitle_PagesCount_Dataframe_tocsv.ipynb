Monday, October 19, 2009\f       Assignment•Binding a variable in Python means setting a name to hold a reference to some object.•Assignment creates references, not copies•Names in Python do not have an intrinsic type.  Objects have types.•Python determines the type of the reference automatically based on the data object assigned to it.•You create a name the first time it appears on the left side of an assignment expression:    !x = 3•A reference is deleted via garbage collection after any names bound to it have passed out of scope.Monday, October 19, 2009\f       Accessing Non-Existent Names•If you try to access a name before it’s been properly created (by placing it on the left side of an assignment), you’ll get an error.  >>> yTraceback (most recent call last):  File \"<pyshell#16>\", line 1, in -toplevel-    yNameError: name ‘y' is not defined>>> y = 3>>> y3Monday, October 19, 2009\f       Multiple Assignment•You can also assign to multiple names at the same time.  >>> x, y = 2, 3>>> x2>>> y3 Monday, October 19, 2009\f       Naming Rules•Names are case sensitive and cannot start with a number.
